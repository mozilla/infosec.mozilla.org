description: Most important security principles to follow - the baseline
---

*This document defines a set of security principles that all operational groups at Mozilla must follow. The principles
are designed to reduce the exposure of our systems and services from attackers who could gain privileged access and
compromise sensitive data.  [The Firefox Operations Security](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/FirefoxOperations) and
the [Security](https://infosec.mozilla.org/) teams maintain the list of principles, and work with
operational teams throughout Mozilla to ensure their implementation.*


**NOTE:** The “**do**” and “**do not**” used in this document are example of controls or implementation of the
principles, but do not represent an exhaustive list of possibilities. Mozilla teams may also find [example violations
here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g6srH_oOvDH9u207VW_sIlgxkJwjPufqCCczWVkM6w4).

# Least Privilege

## Do not expose unnecessary services

**Goal:** Limiting the amount of reachable or usable services to the necessary minimum.

**Do**

-   List all services presented to the network (Internet and Intranets). Justify the presence of each port or service.

**Do not**

-   OpenSSH Server (sshd) is running but no users ever login.
-   A web-application has a web accessible administration interface, but it is not used.
-   A database server (SQL) allows connections from any machine in the same VLAN, even though only a single machine
    needs to access it.
-   The administration login panel of the network switch for the office network is accessible by users of the office
    network.

## Do not grant or retain permissions that are no longer needed

**Goal:** Expire user access to data or services when users no longer need them.

**Do**

-   Use role-based access control (allows for easy granular escalation of privileges, only when necessary)
-   Expire access automatically when unused.
-   Automatically disable API keys after not having been used for a given period of time and notify the user.
-   Use different accounts for different role types (admin, developer, user, etc.) when no good role-based access
    control is available.
-   Routinely review user’s access permissions to ensure they’re still needed.

**Do not**

-   Grant global root access (e.g. via 'sudo') for all operation engineers on all systems.
-   Give access “just in case".
-   Retain access to services that you no longer use.

# Defense in Depth

## Do not allow lateral movement

**Goal:** Make it difficult or impossible for an attacker to move from one host in the network to another host.

**Do**

-   Prevent inbound network access to services on a host from clients that do not need access to the service through
    either host-based firewall rules, network firewall rules/AWS security groups, or both (which is preferred).
-   Clearly enforce which teams have access to which set of systems.
-   Alert on network flows being established between difference services.

**Do not**

-   Allow inbound OpenSSH, RDP connections from any host on any network.
-   Run unpatched container management services (e.g. Docker) or kernels which allow a user in one container to escape
    the container and affect other containers on the same host.

## Isolate environments

**Goal:** Separating infrastructure and services from each other in order to limit the the impact of a security breach.

**Do**

-   In cases where two distinct systems are used to govern access or authorization (e.g. Okta and Duo), ensure that no
    single user or role has administrative permissions across both systems.
-   Use separate sets of credentials for different environments.

**Do not**

-   Have system administrators with access to every system/every service.
-   Establish service users with access to multiple services.
-   Allow tools remotely executing code on systems from a centralized location (single Puppet Master, Ansible Tower,
    Nagios, etc. instance) across multiple services.
-   Re-use functionality across services when not required (such as sharing load balancers, databases, etc.)

## Patch Systems

**Goal:** Ensuring systems and software do not contain vulnerabilities when these are found in software over time.

**Do**

-   Establish regular recurring maintenance windows in which to patch software.
-   Ensure individual systems can be turned off and back on without affecting service availability.
-   Enable automatic patching where possible.
-   Check web application libraries and dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Meet Web Standards

**Goal:** Reduce exposure to web attacks by following the [web security standards](../guidelines/web_security).

**Do**

-   Achieve B+ or higher on [Mozilla's Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org).
-   Follow the [Web Security Guidelines](../guidelines/web_security).

## Guarantee data integrity and confidentiality

**Goal:** Ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity is respected throughout its lifecycle.

**Do**

-   Use full-disk encryption where available on systems without physical security (laptops and mobile phones).
-   Encrypt credentials storage databases (Ansible Vault, Credstash, etc.)
-   Encrypt data in transit with TLS (during transmission).
-   Also encrypt data in transit inside the internal network.

**Do not**

-   Terminate TLS (e.g. with a reverse proxy or load balancer) outside a system and then transmit the data in clear-text
    across the rest of the network.
-   Use STARTTLS without also disabling clear-text connections.
-   Rely on outdated or weak encryption protocols (e.g. DES, RC4).

# Know Thy System

## Fraud detection and forensics

**Goal:** Inspect events in real-time in order to alert on suspicious behavior, and store system behavior information in
order to retrace actions after a security breach.

**Do**

-   Audit and log system calls (e.g. with auditd or Windows Audit) made by processes when running in an operating system
    you control (e.g. not AWS Lambda)
-   Send logs off the account or system (e.g. AWS CloudTrail, system logs, etc.) outside of the account or system
    (different AWS account, MozDef, Papertrail, etc.)
-   Detect and alert on anomalous changes.

## Are you at risk?

**Goal:** Assessing how exposed you are to danger, harm or loss.

**Do**

-   Run [Rapid Risk Assessments (RRA)](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Risk_management/Rapid_Risk_Assessment)
    for your services.
-   Estimate what would be the impact if your service was compromised.

**Do not**

-   Think it will never happen to you.

## Inventory the Landscape

**Goal:** Provide an accurate, maintained catalog, or system of records for all assets.

**Do**

-   Keep an inventory of services and service owners.
-   Keep an inventory of machines (e.g. ServiceNow, AWS Config, Infoblox, etc.) which is updated automatically.
-   Ensure that the inventory contains IP addresses of systems in particular when using IPv6 (which cannot realistically
    be scanned).

## KISS - Keep It Simple and thus Secure

**Goal:** *KISS comes from ['Keep It Simple, Stupid'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). You can only secure
a system that you can completely understand.*

**Do**

-   Keep things simple. Prefer simplicity over a complex and specific architecture.
-   Ensure others can understand the design.
-   Use standardized tooling that others already know how to use.
-   Draw high-level data flow diagrams.

# Authentication and authorization

## Require two-factor authentication

**Goal:** Require 2FA (or MFA) on all services internal or external to prevent attackers from reusing or guessing a
single credential such as a password.

*MFA (multi-factor authentication, also called 2FA for two-factors) is method of confirming a user's claimed identity by
utilizing a combination of two different components such as something you know (password) and something you have
(phone).*

*See also why: [Rationales\#mfa](rationales#mfa).*

**Do**

-   Use an SSO (Single Sign On) solution with MFA.
-   For services that can not support SSO, use the service’s individual MFA features (e.g. GitHub and Google MFA).
-   Servers carrying secrets or widespread access (or any other potentially sensitive data) should verify the user's
    identity end to end, such as by prompting for an additional MFA verification when connecting to the server, even
    when behind a bastion host.


## Use central identity management (Single Sign-On)

**Goal:** Minimize credential theft and identity mismanagement by minimizing the handling of user credentials such as
password, MFA to a set of dedicated systems.

**Do**

-   Use an SSO (Single Sign-On) solution that authenticates users credentials on your service’s behalf.
-   Servers update their user sessions from the SSO systems regularly to ensure the user is still active and valid.
-   Use authorization (e.g. group membership) data from the SSO system (possibly, in addition to your own authorization
    data)

**Do not**

-   Accept, process, transmit or store user credentials (passwords, OTPs, keys, etc.) Let the authentication server
    directly handle that data.
-   Use direct LDAP authentication for users.

*See also why: [Rationales\#decentralized-user-account-management](rationales#decentralized-user-account-management).*


## Require strong authentication

**Goal:** Use credential-based authentication and user session management to grant access.

*See also why: [Rationales\#shared-passwords](rationales#shared-passwords),
[Rationales\#password-reuse](rationales#password-reuse).*

**Do**

-   Use credential-based authentication and user session management where the session information is passed by the user
    (https://research.google.com/pubs/pub44860.html)
-   Use API keys for service authentication.
    -   Prefer using asymmetric API keys with request signing (e.g. x509 client certificates, AWS Signature) over symmetric
        API keys (e.g. HTTP header) where possible.
    -   Ensure that API keys can be automatically rotated in the case of a data leak.
-   Use a password manager to store distinct passwords for each service a user accesses.
-   Use purpose-built credential sharing mechanisms when sharing is required (1password for teams, LastPass, etc.)

**Do not**

-   Use easy to guess passwords or vendor default passwords.
-   Send your password to other individuals.
-   Send shared passwords over email or communication mediums other than purpose-built credential sharing mechanisms.
-   Use the same password for multiple services.
-   Trust traffic from a certain network address.
-   Rely on VLANs or AWS VPCs to indicate requests are safe.
-   Use IP ACLs as replacement for authentication.
-   Trust the office network for access to devices.
-   Use [TCP Wrapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Wrapper) for access control.
-   Use machine API keys for user authentication.
-   Use user credentials for machine authentication.
-   Store API keys on devices that are not physically secure (e.g. laptops or mobile phones)
