# Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL)

Transport Layer Security provides assurances about the confidentiality, authentication, and integrity of all communications both inside and outside of Mozilla. To protect our users and networked systems, the support and use of encrypted communications using TLS is mandatory for all systems.

## HTTPS

Websites or API endpoints that only communicate with modern browsers and systems should use the [Mozilla modern TLS configuration](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Modern_compatibility).

Websites intended for general public consumption should use the [Mozilla intermediate TLS configuration](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Intermediate_compatibility_.28recommended.29).

Websites that require backwards compatibility with extremely old browsers and operating systems may use the [Mozilla backwards compatible TLS configuration](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Old_backward_compatibility). This is not recommended, and use of this compatibility level should be done only after consulting the security team for a risk assessment.

### Compatibility

| Configuration              | Oldest compatible clients                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Modern                     | Firefox 63, Android 10.0, Chrome 70, Edge 75, Java 11, OpenSSL 1.1.1, Opera 57, and Safari 12.1               |
| Intermediate               | Firefox 27, Android 4.4.2, Chrome 31, Edge, IE 11 on Windows 7, Java 8u31, OpenSSL 1.0.1, Opera 20, Safari 9  |
| Backwards Compatible (Old) | Firefox 1, Android 2.3, Chrome 1, Edge 12, IE8 on Windows XP, Java 6, OpenSSL 0.9.8, Opera 5, and Safari 1    |

## HTTP Strict Transport Security

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is an HTTP header that notifies user agents to only connect to a given site over HTTPS, even if the scheme chosen was HTTP. Browsers that have had HSTS set for a given site will transparently upgrade all requests to HTTPS. HSTS also tells the browser to treat TLS and certificate-related errors more strictly by disabling the ability for users to bypass the error page.

The header consists of one mandatory parameter (`max-age`) and two optional parameters (`includeSubDomains` and `preload`), separated by semicolons.

### Directives

- `max-age:` how long user agents will redirect to HTTPS, in seconds
- `includeSubDomains:` whether user agents should upgrade requests on subdomains
- `preload:` whether the site should be included in the [HSTS preload list](https://hstspreload.org/)

`max-age` must be set to a minimum of six months (15768000), but longer periods such as two years (63072000) are recommended. Note that once this value is set, the site must continue to support HTTPS until the expiry time has been reached.

`includeSubDomains` notifies the browser that all subdomains of the current origin should also be upgraded via HSTS. For example, setting `includeSubDomains` on `domain.example.com` will also set it on `host1.domain.example.com` and `host2.domain.example.com`. Extreme care is needed when setting the `includeSubDomains` flag, as it could disable sites on subdomains that don't yet have HTTPS enabled.

`preload` allows the website to be included in the [HSTS preload list](https://hstspreload.org/), upon submission. As a result, web browsers will do HTTPS upgrades to the site without ever having to receive the initial HSTS header. This prevents downgrade attacks upon first use and is recommended for all high risk websites. Note that being included in the HSTS preload list requires that `includeSubDomains` also be set.

### Examples

```sh
# Only connect to this site via HTTPS for the two years (recommended)
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000
```

```sh
# Only connect to this site and subdomains via HTTPS for the next two years and also include in the preload list
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

- [RFC6797: HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797)

## HTTP Redirections

Websites may continue to listen on port 80 (HTTP) so that users do not get connection errors when typing a URL into their address bar, as browsers currently connect via HTTP for their initial request. Sites that listen on port 80 should only redirect to the same resource on HTTPS. Once the redirection has occurred, [HSTS](#http-strict-transport-security) should ensure that all future attempts go to the site via HTTP are instead sent directly to the secure site. APIs or websites not intended for public consumption should disable the use of HTTP entirely.

Sites should avoid redirections from HTTP to HTTPS on a different host, as this prevents HSTS from being set.  Instead, for example, first redirect from http://example.com/ to https://example.com/ and then in a second redirect, redirect from https://example.com/ to https://example.org/

### Examples

```nginx
# Redirect all incoming http requests to the same site and URI on https, using nginx
server {
  listen 80;

  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

```apache
# Redirect for site.example.org from http to https, using Apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName site.example.org
  Redirect permanent / https://site.example.org/
</VirtualHost>
```

## Resource Loading

All resources — whether on the same origin or not — should be loaded over secure channels. Secure (HTTPS) websites that attempt to load active resources such as JavaScript insecurely will be blocked by browsers. As a result, users will experience degraded UIs and “mixed content” warnings. Attempts to load passive content (such as images) insecurely, although less risky, will still lead to degraded UIs and can allow active attackers to deface websites or phish users.

Despite the fact that modern browsers make it evident that websites are loading resources insecurely, these errors still occur with significant frequency. To prevent this from occurring, developers should verify that all resources are loaded securely prior to deployment.

### Examples

```html
<!-- HTTPS is a fantastic way to load a JavaScript resource -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script>
```

```html
<!-- Attempts to load over HTTP will be blocked and will generate mixed content warnings -->
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script>
```

```html
<!-- Although passive content won't be blocked, it will still generate mixed content warnings -->
<img src="http://very.badssl.com/image.jpg">
```

# Content Security Policy

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP header that allows site operators fine-grained control over where resources on their site can be loaded from. The use of this header is the best method to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.

The primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript. Inline JavaScript -- either reflected or stored -- means that improperly escaped user-inputs can generate code that is interpreted by the web browser as JavaScript. By using CSP to disable inline JavaScript, you can effectively eliminate almost all XSS attacks against your site.

Note that disabling inline JavaScript means that <em>all</em> JavaScript must be loaded from `<script>` src tags . Event handlers such as <em>onclick</em> used directly on a tag will fail to work, as will JavaScript inside `<script>` tags but not loaded via `src`. Furthermore, inline stylesheets using either `<style>` tags or the `style` attribute will also fail to load. As such, care must be taken when designing sites so that CSP becomes easier to implement.

## Implementation Notes

- Aiming for `default-src https:` is a great first goal, as it disables inline code and requires https.
- For existing websites with large codebases that would require too much work to disable inline scripts, `default-src https: 'unsafe-inline'` is still helpful, as it keeps resources from being accidentally loaded over http. However, it does not provide any XSS protection.
- It is recommended to start with a reasonably locked down policy such as `default-src 'none'; img-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'` and then add in sources as revealed during testing.
- In lieu of the preferred HTTP header, pages can instead include a `<meta http-equiv=`“`Content-Security-Policy`”` content=`“`…`”`>` tag. If they do, it should be the first `<meta>` tag that appears inside `<head>`.
- Care needs to be taken with `data:` URIs, as these are unsafe inside `script-src` and `object-src` (or inherited from `default-src`).
- Similarly, the use of `script-src 'self'` can be unsafe for sites with JSONP endpoints. These sites should use a `script-src` that includes the path to their JavaScript source folder(s).
- Unless sites need the ability to execute plugins such as Flash or Silverlight, they should disable their execution with `object-src 'none'`.
- Sites should ideally use the `report-uri` directive, which POSTs JSON reports about CSP violations that do occur. This allows CSP violations to be caught and repaired quickly.
- Prior to implementation, it is recommended to use the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` HTTP header, to see if any violations would have occurred with that policy.
- Set `form-action` directive to `none` or `self` or to specific sources which are allowed to be used in forms. This directive does not fall back to default-src, therefore, not explicitly setting the directive would allow forms to be submitted to any source.

## Examples

```sh
# Disable unsafe inline/eval, only allow loading of resources (images, fonts, scripts, etc.) over https
# Note that this does not provide any XSS protection
Content-Security-Policy: default-src https:
```

```html
<!-- Do the same thing, but with a <meta> tag -->
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src https:">
```

```sh
# Disable the use of unsafe inline/eval, allow everything else except plugin execution
Content-Security-Policy: default-src *; object-src 'none'
```

```sh
# Disable unsafe inline/eval, only load resources from same origin except also allow images from imgur
# Also disables the execution of plugins
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://i.imgur.com; object-src 'none'
```

```sh
# Disable unsafe inline/eval and plugins, only load scripts and stylesheets from same origin, fonts from google,
# and images from same origin and imgur. Sites should aim for policies like this.
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; font-src https://fonts.gstatic.com;
			 img-src 'self' https://i.imgur.com; object-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'
```

```sh
# Pre-existing site that uses too much inline code to fix
# but wants to ensure resources are loaded only over https and disable plugins
Content-Security-Policy: default-src https: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; object-src 'none'
```

```sh
# Don't implement the above policy yet; instead just report violations that would have occurred
Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src https:; report-uri /csp-violation-report-endpoint/
```

```sh
# Disable the loading of any resources and disable framing, recommended for APIs to use
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'
```

# Cookies

All cookies should be created such that their access is as limited as possible. This can help minimize damage from cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, as these cookies often contain session identifiers or other sensitive information.

## Directives

- Name: Cookie names may be either be prepended with either `__Secure-` or `__Host-` to prevent cookies from being overwritten by insecure sources
  - Use `__Host-` for all cookies needed only on a specific domain (no subdomains) where `Path` is set to `/`
  - Use `__Secure-` for all other cookies sent from secure origins (such as HTTPS)
- `Secure`: All cookies must be set with the `Secure` flag, indicating that they should only be sent over HTTPS
- `HttpOnly:` Cookies that don't require access from JavaScript should be set with the `HttpOnly` flag
- Expiration: Cookies should expire as soon as is necessary: session identifiers in particular should expire quickly
  - `Expires:` Sets an absolute expiration date for a given cookie
  - `Max-Age:` Sets a relative expiration date for a given cookie (not supported by IE <8)
- `Domain:` Cookies should only be set with this if they need to be accessible on other domains, and should be set to the most restrictive domain possible
- `Path:` Cookies should be set to the most restrictive path possible, but for most applications this will be set to the root directory
- `SameSite`: Forbid sending the cookie via cross-origin requests (such as from `<img>` tags, etc.), as a strong [anti-CSRF measure](#csrf-prevention)
  - `SameSite=Strict`: Only send the cookie when site is directly navigated to
  - `SameSite=Lax`: Send the cookie when navigating to your site from another site

## Examples

```sh
# Session identifier cookie only accessible on this host that gets purged when the user closes their browser
Set-Cookie: MOZSESSIONID=980e5da39d4b472b9f504cac9; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
```

```sh
# Session identifier for all example.org sites that expires in 30 days using the __Secure- prefix
# This cookie is not sent cross-origin, but is sent when navigating to any Mozilla site from another site
Set-Cookie: __Secure-MOZSESSIONID=7307d70a86bd4ab5a00499762; Max-Age=2592000; Domain=example.org; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax
```

```sh
# Sets a long-lived cookie for the current host, accessible by Javascript, when the user accepts the ToS
# This cookie is sent when navigating to your sent from another site, such as by clicking a link
Set-Cookie: __Host-ACCEPTEDTOS=true; Expires=Fri, 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax
```

```sh
# Session identifier used for a secure site, such as bugzilla.example.org. It isn't sent from cross-origin
# requests, nor is it sent when navigating to bugzilla.example.org from another site. Used in conjunction with
# other anti-CSRF measures, this is a very strong way to defend your site against CSRF attacks.
Set-Cookie: __Host-BMOSESSIONID=YnVnemlsbGE=; Max-Age=2592000; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict
```

# Cross-origin Resource Sharing

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is an HTTP header that defines which foreign origins are allowed to access the content of pages on your domain via scripts using methods such as XMLHttpRequest. `crossdomain.xml` and `clientaccesspolicy.xml` provide similar functionality, but for Flash and Silverlight-based applications, respectively.

These should not be present unless specifically needed. Use cases include content delivery networks (CDNs) that provide hosting for JavaScript/CSS libraries and public API endpoints. If present, they should be locked down to as few origins and resources as is needed for proper function. For example, if your server provides both a website and an API intended for XMLHttpRequest access on a remote websites, <em>only</em> the API resources should return the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Failure to do so will allow foreign origins to read the contents of any page on your origin.

## Examples

```sh
# Allow any site to read the contents of this JavaScript library, so that subresource integrity works
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

```sh
# Allow https://random-dashboard.example.org to read the returned results of this API
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://random-dashboard.example.org
```

```xml
<!-- Allow Flash from https://random-dashboard.example.org to read page contents -->
<cross-domain-policy xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://www.adobe.com/xml/schemas/PolicyFile.xsd">
  <allow-access-from domain="random-dashboard.example.org"/>
  <site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies="master-only"/>
  <allow-http-request-headers-from domain="random-dashboard.example.org" headers="*" secure="true"/>
</cross-domain-policy>
```

```xml
<!-- The same thing, but for Silverlight-->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<access-policy>
  <cross-domain-access>
    <policy>
      <allow-from http-request-headers="*">
        <domain uri="https://random-dashboard.example.org"/>
      </allow-from>
      <grant-to>
        <resource path="/" include-subpaths="true"/>
      </grant-to>
    </policy>
  </cross-domain-access>
</access-policy>
```

# CSRF Prevention

Cross-site request forgeries are a class of attacks where unauthorized commands are transmitted to a website from a trusted user. Because they inherit the users cookies (and hence session information), they appear to be validly issued commands. A CSRF attack might look like this:

```
<!-- Attempt to delete a user's account -->
<img src="https://accounts.example.org/management/delete?confirm=true">
```

When a user visits a page with that HTML fragment, the browser will attempt to make a GET request to that URL. If the user is logged in, the browser will provide their session cookies and the account deletion attempt will be successful.

While there are a variety of mitigation strategies such as Origin/Referrer checking and challenge-response systems (such as [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA)), the most common and transparent method of CSRF mitigation is through the use of anti-CSRF tokens. Anti-CSRF tokens prevent CSRF attacks by requiring the existence of a secret, unique, and unpredictable token on all destructive changes. These tokens can be set for an entire user session, rotated on a regular basis, or be created uniquely for each request. Although [`SameSite`](#Cookies) cookies are the best defense against CSRF attacks, they are not yet fully supported in all browsers and should be used in conjunction with other anti-CSRF defenses.

## Examples

```html
<!-- A secret anti-CSRF token, included in the form to delete an account -->
<input type="hidden" name="csrftoken" value="1df93e1eafa42012f9a8aff062eeb1db0380b">
```

```sh
# Server-side: set an anti-CSRF cookie that JavaScript must send as an X header, which can't be done cross-origin
Set-Cookie: CSRFTOKEN=1df93e1eafa42012f9a8aff062eeb1db0380b; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Strict
```

```javascript
// Client-side, have JavaScript add it as an X header to the XMLHttpRequest
var token = readCookie(CSRFTOKEN);                   // read the cookie
httpRequest.setRequestHeader('X-CSRF-Token', token); // add it as an X-CSRF-Token header
```

# Referrer Policy

When a user navigates to a site via a hyperlink or a website loads an external resource, browsers inform the destination site of the origin of the requests through the use of the HTTP `Referer` (sic) header. Although this can be useful for a variety of purposes, it can also place the privacy of users at risk. HTTP Referrer Policy allows sites to have fine-grained control over how and when browsers transmit the HTTP `Referer` header.

In legacy browsers, if a page at <https://example.com/page.html> contains `<img src="https://not.example.com/image.jpg">`, then the browser will send a request like this:

```http
GET /image.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: not.example.com
Referer: https://example.com/page.html
```

In addition to the privacy risks that this entails, the browser may also transmit internal-use-only URLs that it may not have intended to reveal. If you as the site operator want to limit the exposure of this information, you can use HTTP Referrer Policy to either eliminate the `Referer` header or reduce the amount of information that it contains.

## Directives

- `no-referrer`: never send the `Referer` header
- `same-origin`: send referrer, but only on requests to the same origin
- `strict-origin`: send referrer to all origins, but only the URL without the path (e.g. <https://example.com/>)
- `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`: send full referrer on same origin, URL without the path on foreign origin

## Notes

Although there are other options for referrer policies, they do not protect user privacy and limit exposure in the same way as the options above.

`strict-origin-when-cross-origin` is the default behavior for all current browsers.

Referrer Policy has good support across modern browsers. In recent versions of Firefox and Safari, "unsafe" directives (`no-referrer-when-downgrade`, `origin-when-cross-origin`, and `unsafe-url`) will behave like the default of `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.

## Examples

```sh
# On example.com, only send the Referer header when loading or linking to other example.com resources
Referrer-Policy: same-origin
```

```sh
# Only send the shortened referrer to a foreign origin, full referrer to a local host
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

```sh
# Disable referrers for browsers that don't support strict-origin-when-cross-origin
# Uses strict-origin-when-cross-origin for browsers that do
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer, strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

```html
<!-- Do the same, but with a meta tag -->
<meta http-equiv="Referrer-Policy" content="no-referrer, strict-origin-when-cross-origin">
```

```html
<!-- referrerpolicy doesn't support multiple values, so only set no-referrer -->
<a href="https://example.org/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
```

# robots.txt

`robots.txt` is a text file placed within the root directory of a site that tells robots (such as indexers employed by search engines) how to behave, by instructing them not to crawl certain paths on the website. This is particularly useful for reducing load on your website through disabling the crawling of automatically generated content. It can also be helpful for preventing the pollution of search results, for resources that don't benefit from being searchable.

Sites may optionally use robots.txt, but should only use it for these purposes. It should not be used as a way to prevent the disclosure of private information or to hide portions of a website. Although this does prevent these sites from appearing in search engines, it does not prevent its discovery from attackers, as `robots.txt` is frequently used for reconnaissance.

## Examples

```sh
# Stop all search engines from crawling this site
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

```sh
# Using robots.txt to hide certain directories is a terrible idea
User-agent: *
Disallow: /secret/admin-interface
```

# Subresource Integrity

Subresource integrity is a recent W3C standard that protects against attackers modifying the contents of JavaScript libraries hosted on content delivery networks (CDNs) in order to create vulnerabilities in all websites that make use of that hosted library.

For example, JavaScript code on jquery.org that is loaded from example.org has access to the entire contents of everything of example.org. If this resource was successfully attacked, it could modify download links, deface the site, steal credentials, cause denial-of-service attacks, and more.

Subresource integrity locks an external JavaScript resource to its known contents at a specific point in time. If the file is modified at any point thereafter, supporting web browsers will refuse to load it. As such, the use of subresource integrity is mandatory for all external JavaScript resources loaded from sources not hosted on Mozilla-controlled systems.

Note that CDNs must support the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) standard by setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Most CDNs already do this, but if the CDN you are loading does not support CORS, please contact the Security Assurance team. We are happy to contact the CDN on your behalf.

## Directives

- `integrity:` a cryptographic hash of the file, prepended with the hash function used to generate it
- `crossorigin:` should be `anonymous` to inform browsers to send anonymous requests without cookies

## Examples

```html
<!-- Load jQuery 2.1.4 from their CDN -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-R4/ztc4ZlRqWjqIuvf6RX5yb/v90qNGx6fS48N0tRxiGkqveZETq72KgDVJCp2TC"
  crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

```html
<!-- Load AngularJS 1.4.8 from their CDN -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-r1y8TJcloKTvouxnYsi4PJAx+nHNr90ibsEn3zznzDzWBN9X3o3kbHLSgcIPtzAp"
  crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

```sh
# Generate the hash myself
$ curl -s https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js | \
    openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | \
    openssl base64 -A

r1y8TJcloKTvouxnYsi4PJAx+nHNr90ibsEn3zznzDzWBN9X3o3kbHLSgcIPtzAp
```

# X-Content-Type-Options

`X-Content-Type-Options` is a header supported by Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox 50+ that tells it not to load scripts and stylesheets unless the server indicates the correct MIME type. Without this header, these browsers can incorrectly detect files as scripts and stylesheets, leading to XSS attacks. As such, all sites must set the `X-Content-Type-Options` header and the appropriate MIME types for files that they serve.

## Examples

```sh
# Prevent browsers from incorrectly detecting non-scripts as scripts
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

# X-Frame-Options

`X-Frame-Options` is an HTTP header that allows sites control over how your site may be framed within an iframe. Clickjacking is a practical attack that allows malicious sites to trick users into clicking links on your site even though they may appear to not be on your site at all. As such, the use of the `X-Frame-Options` header is mandatory for all new websites, and all existing websites are expected to add support for `X-Frame-Options` as soon as possible.

Note that `X-Frame-Options` has been superseded by the Content Security Policy's `frame-ancestors` directive, which allows considerably more granular control over the origins allowed to frame a site. As `frame-ancestors` is not yet supported in IE11 and older, Edge, Safari 9.1 (desktop), and Safari 9.2 (iOS), it is recommended that sites employ `X-Frame-Options` in addition to using CSP.

Sites that require the ability to be iframed must use either Content Security Policy and/or employ JavaScript defenses to prevent clickjacking from malicious origins.

## Directives

- `DENY`: disallow allow attempts to iframe site (recommended)
- `SAMEORIGIN`: allow the site to iframe itself
- `ALLOW-FROM `<em>`uri`</em>: deprecated; instead use CSP's `frame-ancestors` directive

## Examples

```sh
# Block site from being framed with X-Frame-Options and CSP
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

```sh
# Only allow my site to frame itself
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
```

```sh
# Allow only framer.example.org to frame site
# Note that this blocks framing from browsers that don't support CSP2+
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://framer.example.org
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```
