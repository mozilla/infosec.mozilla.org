# Root User

If an attacker gains control of the root user in an AWS account, there
is no higher authority role that a security incident responder can use
to eradicate the attackers access. With root user access, the attacker
can exploit the resources in the AWS account and infosec will have
little ability to respond.

## Use a strong unique password for the root user

-   How to : Generate a password with a password manager and store that
    password in a password manager protected by MFA or offline as it is
    rarely if ever needed. One way to store the MFA offline is to use
    the infosec [security backup
    service](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SECURITY/Security+backup+service)
-   Audited : False
-   Rationale
    -   [Non-unique passwords are
        risky](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Fundamentals#password-reuse)
    -   Weak passwords can be guessed or brute forced

## Enable multi factor authentication (MFA) for the root user

-   How to :
    [Instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html#enable-virt-mfa-for-root)
-   Audited : True
-   Rationale
    -   [MFA is an effective means of preventing unauthorized
        access](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Fundamentals#mfa)

## Avoid creating API keys for the root user

-   How to : Instead of creating API keys for the root user, create them
    for an IAM user
-   Audited : False
-   Rationale
    -   API keys bypass the requirement for MFA and enable an attacker
        to takeover an AWS account merely by compromising a computer
        containing the root user's API keys.
    -   Virtually all actions that the root user can execute can also be
        executed by an IAM user, obviating the need to create API keys
        for the root user and use the root users permissions.

## Avoid logging in as the root user

-   How to : Instead of logging in as the root user, log in as an IAM
    user with the permissions that you need to complete your task
-   Audited : False
-   Rationale
    -   Limiting the frequency with which the root user's password and
        MFA are used, reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker
        with unauthorized access to a user's computer to escalate their
        access from the user's computer to the AWS account's root user
    -   Virtually all actions that the root user can execute can also be
        executed by an IAM user.

# CloudTrail

CloudTrail logs enable infosec to perform incident response when an
account has been compromised.

## Use the Mozilla Secure CloudTrail Storage System

-   How to : If your AWS account does not have CloudTrail enabled and
    sending to the Mozilla Secure CloudTrail Storage System, you can
    enable it by following these
    [instructions](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SECURITY/AWS+Secure+CloudTrail+Storage+System#AWSSecureCloudTrailStorageSystem-HowtoenableyourMozillaAWSaccounttousetheSecureCloudTrailStorageSystem)
-   Audited : True
-   Rationale
    -   In order to protect the CloudTrail logs that AWS produces from
        an attacker who compromised your AWS account from deleting them,
        the Mozilla Secure CloudTrail Storage System causes AWS to ship
        these logs to a segregated and secure AWS account, separate from
        your own. This ensures that if an attacker compromises your AWS
        account, they will not be able to destroy the records of what
        changes they made to your account.

# Route53

## Avoid leaving DNS records in Route53 that resolve to third party services which you are no longer using

-   How to : Review the DNS records you have setup in DNS zones hosted
    in Route53. Look for records which resolve to IPs or names of third
    party services (e.g. GitHub, Heroku, AmazonAWS ) but which are not
    setup and configured with that third party service. For example,
    look for a CNAME that [resolves to
    foo.github.io](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-www-subdomain/)
    but when browsed to returns a 404 "Site not found . GitHub Pages"
-   Audited : False
-   Rationale
    -   If an attacker registers an account with a third party service
        for which your Route53 zone contains a record pointing to that
        service, the attacker can then host their malicious content on
        their site with your domain name. With this they could create a
        phishing site in your DNS domain, exploit same origin bugs,
        obtain domain wide cookies from users and execute cross site
        scripting attacks.

# S3

## Avoid unintentionally granting public access to non-public S3 data

-   How to : Review S3 bucket policies for the presence of policy
    statements which permit a Principle of "\*" as the actions granted
    in that statement (for example reading content from the S3 bucket or
    writing to the bucket) will be available to everyone
-   Audited : True
-   Rationale
    -   Data not classified as Public shouldn't be readable or
        modifiable by the public.

# Security Groups

## Use inbound security group rules instead of outbound security group rules to govern access

-   How to : When creating security groups, only create inbound rules on
    systems to allow inbound connections. Do not create outbound rules
    on systems that initiate connections to other systems. Outbound
    rules in security groups should be open/permissive. The exception to
    this is security groups that control outbound access to the
    internet. These security groups can and should have outbound rules
-   Audited : False
-   Rationale
    -   If a security group contains both inbound and outbound rules or
        if the union of all security groups contain both inbound and
        outbound rules, the resulting apparent access can easily differ
        from the actual access being granted. Mixing inbound and
        outbound rules makes it very difficult to determine the
        resulting behavior of all rules combined. This complexity and
        difference between the apparent behavior and the actual behavior
        can expose systems to an attacker unintentionally
    -   The only place where outbound rules should be used is the one
        case where they are necessary; when constraining outbound access
        from AWS resources to the internet.

## Disallow inbound network access by default

-   How to : When creating security groups, only allow inbound access to
    ports that are required. Avoid creating overly broad rules which
    allow more ports than are required for the services hosted on the
    systems protected by that security group.
-   Audited : False
-   Rationale
    -   Security Principle : [Do not present unnecessary
        services](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Fundamentals/Security_Principles#Do_not_present_unnecessary_services)
    -   Limiting the network access an attacker has to a resource,
        limits the size of the attack surface and the likelihood that
        the attacker will be able to exploit the resource.

## Disallow inbound network access from internal resources

-   How to : By default, every AWS VPC is created with a single
    "default" security group. This security group allows inbound
    connections on all ports from all resources which are also part of
    the same security group. The result of this is that any resource
    which is part of this security is reachable over all ports from
    other resources in the same security group.
    -   Modify the default security group and delete the "All traffic"
        rule allowing inbound connections.
    -   Avoid creating any security group with a rule allowing all
        inbound ports to either itself or other security groups
-   Audited : False
-   Rationale
    -   Security Principle : [Do not present unnecessary
        services](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Fundamentals/Security_Principles#Do_not_present_unnecessary_services)
    -   Security Principle [Do not allow lateral
        movement](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Fundamentals/Security_Principles#Do_not_allow_lateral_movement)
    -   AWS creates this default security group as a convenience so that
        all resources you create can, by default, communicate with each
        other. Unfortunately, this convenience results in an attacker
        that gains access to one system being able to attack any service
        listening on any other internal system.

## Disallow outbound internet access except through HTTP proxy on NSM server

-   How to
    -   Implement the [recommended deployment of network security
        monitoring (NSM) on a NAT
        instance](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/POLICIES/Standard%3A+Network+Security+monitoring+in+AWS)
        in your AWS account
    -   Ensure that *all* security groups in the account, other than the
        security group used by the NSM server, disallow outbound access
        to the internet
    -   Ensure that systems which need outbound internet access are part
        of a security group which allows outbound access to the NSM
        server
    -   Ensure that all services which need outbound access to the
        internet and can be configured to use an HTTP proxy, use the
        HTTP proxy running on the NAT instance instead of traversing the
        NSM server directly
-   Audited : False
-   Rationale
    -   Sending outbound internet traffic through a network security
        monitoring server allows for inspection of the traffic and
        detection of signatures revealing compromised servers in the
        VPC.
    -   Sending outbound internet traffic through an http proxy allows
        for limiting internet destinations that internal systems can
        reach which will prevent an attacker who compromises a system
        from exfiltrating data.
